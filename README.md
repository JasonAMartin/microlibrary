# microlibrary

Just testing out creating a microlibrary for GH, NPM, etc. This library does nothing special. It has a list of games that I've played and it returns all of them or a random one.

![Just messing around with Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/microlibrary.svg)

- using mocha / chai

##Use:

npm install microlibrary
